            specified in the description of the product? What if you go to a
            restaurant for the first time and don&#39;t know what to order? Are
            you tired of always ordering the sasme food because you are afraid of
            not getting something you like?{"\n"}
            {"\n"}Foodwayz is the solution! As our application is focused on the
